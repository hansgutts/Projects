This Folder contains the files that make up my work in progress game "Star Rancher".

As it stands right now, this name has very little to do with the game aspects, but I'm still learning the basics. The hope of this game is to make something inspired by Slime rancher but more comelling. While playing slime rancher I wished the crafting system was more fulfiling and wished for new environments and puzzles and that is my goal.
